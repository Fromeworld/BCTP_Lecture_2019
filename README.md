# Supplementary material for the BCTP Lecture Series

On this Github repository, I collect files I coded during the afternoon sessions of the BCTP Lecture Series [Machine Learning and its Applications](https://indico.desy.de/indico/event/23325/).

## Monday
In this session, we created our first feed-forward neural network that learns the xor function. We implemented the neural network in Mathematica, Keras (with tensorflow backend), and PyTorch. The files are available [here](./Monday).
